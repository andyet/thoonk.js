/**
 * A Thoonk Job is a queue which does not completely remove items
 * from the queue until a task completion notice is received.
 * 
 * Job Item Lifecycle:
 *     - A job is created using put() with the data for the job.
 *     - The job is moved to a claimed state when a worker retrieves
 *       the job data from the queue.
 *     - The worker performs any processing required, and calls
 *       finish() with the job's result data.
 *     - The job is marked as finished and removed from the queue.
 * 
 * Alternative: Job Cancellation
 *     - After a worker has claimed a job, it calls cancel() with
 *       the job's ID, possibly because of an error or lack of required
 *       resources.
 *     - The job is moved from a claimed state back to the queue.
 * 
 * Alternative: Job Stalling
 *     - A call to stall() with the job ID is made.
 *     - The job is moved out of the queue and into a stalled state. While
 *       stalled, the job will not be dispatched.
 *     - A call to retry() with the job ID is made.
 *     - The job is moved out of the stalled state and back into the queue.
 * 
 * Alternative: Job Deletion
 *     - A call to retract() with the job ID is made.
 *     - The job item is completely removed from the queue and any
 *       other job states.
 * 
 * Redis Keys Used:
 *     feed.published:[feed] -- A time sorted set of queued jobs.
 *     feed.cancelled:[feed] -- A hash table of cancelled jobs.
 *     feed.claimed:[feed]   -- A hash table of claimed jobs.
 *     feed.stalled:[feed]   -- A hash table of stalled jobs.
 *     feeed.funning:[feed]  -- A hash table of running jobs.
 *     feed.finished:[feed]\x00[id] -- Temporary queue for receiving job
 *                                     result data.
 * 
 * Thoonk Standard API:
 *     cancel    -- Move a job from a claimed state back into the queue.
 *     finish    -- Mark a job as completed and store the results.
 *     get       -- Retrieve the next job from the queue.
 *     getIds    -- Return IDs of all jobs in the queue.
 *     getResult -- Retrieve the result of a job.
 *     put       -- Add a new job to the queue.
 *     retract   -- Completely remove a job from use.
 *     retry     -- Resume execution of a stalled job.
 *     stall     -- Pause execution of a queued job.
